# TsunamiProject

Hello welcome on my "Tsunami" Project.

Idea:
The idea for this project I got from goodbrief.io where it generated for me design brief. It gave me name of my company, company description and job description. You can see it on image below:

<div align="center" width="100%">

When it came to create design for this project I used AI tool MidJurney.
